# BehaveNet
# This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on EEG (Electroencephalogram) data and # accelerometer data from sensors capturing acceleration along the x, y, and z axes. The process involves preprocessing the data, # implementing a sliding window technique, and training the CNN.
